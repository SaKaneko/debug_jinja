# debug_jinja
OSS to build debug_jinja

## What is this?
- This repository is a repository of practice programs created by a novice software engineer to learn class design. 
- Most of the code is written in C++.
- The application displays a shrine when you log in on Linux to pray for no fatal bugs today.
- Since this is an application for practicing software engineering, it is overly extensible.
  - I intend to set hook points in several places in the program, and at each hook point I will be able to embed various processes as plug-ins.
